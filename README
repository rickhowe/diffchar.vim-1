This plugin has been developed in order to make diff mode more useful. DiffText does not show the exact difference, but this plugin will highlight its difference, character by character - so called DiffChar.

Use this plugin just after diff command. DiffText area will be narrowed down to show the DiffChar. You can use this plugin in non-diff usual mode as well.

For example, diff command shows: (<|DiffText area|>)

     (file A) The <|swift brown fox jumped over the lazy|> dog.
     (file B) The <|lazy fox jumped over the swift brown|> dog.

then this plugin will narrow down the DiffText area:

     (file A) The <|swift brown|> fox jumped over the <|lazy|> dog.
     (file B) The <|lazy|> fox jumped over the <|swift brown|> dog.

Since update 4.7, vim is able to automatically show the exact differences on diff mode.

This plugin has been always positively supporting mulltibyte characters.

Sample commands
:[range]SDChar - Highlight difference units for [range]
:[range]RDChar - Reset the highlight of difference units for [range]

Configurable sample keymaps
<Plug>ToggleDiffCharAllLines (default: <F7>)
    toggle the highlight/reset of difference units for all lines
<Plug>ToggleDiffCharCurrentLine (default: <F8>)
    toggle the highlight/reset of difference units for current line
<Plug>JumpDiffCharPrevStart (default: [b)
    jump cursor to the start position of the previous difference unit
<Plug>JumpDiffCharNextStart (default: ]b)
    jump cursor to the start position of the next difference unit
<Plug>JumpDiffCharPrevEnd (default: [e)
    jump cursor to the end position of the previous difference unit
<Plug>JumpDiffCharNextEnd (default: ]e)
    jump cursor to the end position of the next difference unit

Global variables (and tab local variables when using t:)
g:DiffUnit - type of difference unit
    "Char"   : any single character (default)
    "Word1"  : \w\+ word and any \W single character
    "Word2"  : non-space and space words
    "Word3"  : \< or \> character class boundaries
    "CSV(,)" : separated by a character such as ',', ';', and '\t'
g:DiffColors - matching colors for changed unit pairs
    0   : always DiffText (default)
    1   : 4 colors in fixed order
    2   : 8 colors in fixed order
    3   : 16 colors in fixed order
    100 : all available colors in dynamic random order
        (notes : always DiffAdd for added units)
g:DiffUpdate - interactively updating of highlightings while editing
    0 : disable (default)
    1 : enable
      (notes : available on vim 7.4)
g:DiffAlgorithm - difference algorithm
    "ONP"   : S.Wu, U.Manber, G.Myers and W.Miller,
              "An O(NP) Sequence Comparison Algorithm" (default)
    "OND"   : E.W.Myers, "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations"
    "Basic" : basic algorithm using edit graph and shortest edit distance

DiffCharExpr(iet, exd) function for the diffexpr option
    iet: 1 = internal algorithm, 0 = external diff command,
          else = threshold value of differences to apply either
    exd: 1 = initially show exact differences, 0 = vim original ones

Update : 4.81
* Enhanced to make DiffCharExpr() a bit faster by using uniq() or so.

Update : 4.8
* Enhanced to set the threshold value on DiffCharExpr() to check how many differences and then apply either of internal algorithm or external diff command. The default for diffexpr option using DiffCharExpr() is changed to use this threshold, 200 - apply internal if less than 200 differences, apply external if more.
* Changed the way to select windows when more than 2 windows in the page.
  - automatically select the diff mode's next (wincmd w) window, if any, in addition to the current window 
  - can select any of splitted windows as vim can do for diff
