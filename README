Update : 3.3
* Enhanced to jump cursor to the DiffChar highlighting units. Sample keymaps "]b" and "[b" will move cursor forwards to the next and backwards to the previous start positions. And "]e" and "[e" will move to the end positions.

Update : 3.2 
* Enhanced to follow diff mode without any limitations. Compare between the corresponding DiffChange lines on both windows and properly handle DiffAdd and DiffDelete lines. 

Update : 3.1
* Enhanced to show/reset/toggle DiffChar highlightings on individual line by line.
* Implemented the window layout handling.
  - the DiffChar'ed windows will remain the highlightings even if the window position is rotated/replaced/moved and another new window opens.
  - if either DiffChar'ed window is closed, reset all the DiffChar highlightings on another window.
* Removed limitations:
  - when more than 2 windows exist, current and next (wincmd w) windows will be selected.
  - if the specified numbers of lines are different in both windows, ignore the redundant lines and continue to compare the text on the same lines.
  - RDChar sample command has a range attribute (e.g. %RDChar).
* Fixed defects:
  - reset just DiffChar highlightings only and remain others.

Update : 3.0
* Implemented word by word differences. A g:DiffUnit variable is a type of a difference unit. Its default is "Char", which will trace character by character as before. "Word1" will split into \w\+ words and any \W single characters. And "Word2" will separate the units at the \s\+ space boundaries.
* Improved the performance around 10%.

Update : 2.1
* Coding changes in the O(NP) function for readability.

Update : 2.0
* Implemented the O(NP) and O(ND) Difference algorithms to improve the performance. This update uses the O(NP) by default, and can be changed to the O(ND) if necessary, or to the basic algorithm implemented in the initial version.

This script has been developed in order to make diff mode more useful. DiffText does not show the exact difference, but this script will highlight its difference, character by character - so called DiffChar.

Use this script just after diff command. DiffText area will be narrowed down to show the DiffChar. You can use this script in non-diff'ed usual mode as well.

For example, diff command shows: (<|DiffText area|>) 

     (file A) The <|swift brown fox jumped over the lazy|> dog. 
     (file B) The <|lazy fox jumped over the swift brown|> dog. 

then this script will narrow down the DiffText area: 

     (file A) The <|swift brown|> fox jumped over the <|lazy|> dog. 
     (file B) The <|lazy|> fox jumped over the <|swift brown|> dog. 

Sample commands:
:[range]SDChar (Highlight DiffChar for [range])
:[range]RDChar (Reset DiffChar for [range])

Sample keymaps:
<F7> (for all lines and toggle the DiffChar highlight)
<F8> (for current line and toggle the DiffChar highlight)
[b (jump to the start position of the previous DiffChar unit)
]b (jump to the start position of the next DiffChar unit)
[e (jump to the end position of the previous DiffChar unit)
]e (jump to the end position of the next DiffChar unit)

This script has been always positively supporting mulltibyte characters.
